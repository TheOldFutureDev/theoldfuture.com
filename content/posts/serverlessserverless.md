Let's talk about the misnomer "Serverless".

Amazon first introduced the Lambda service in 2014 [0] with no
mention of "serverless" (and neither does the Hacker News comment thread[1]). So if the company that first pushed FaaS into the public
didn't invent the term "serverless", who did?

The term "serverless" first became popular around March 2016, almost
two years after the initial launch of Lambda.
