> Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.

John Perry Barlow - February 8, 1996 - Permalink - Original Source (grabbed Feb - 2018)

John P Barlow wrote a long time ago (internet time), warning the governments of
the time that they won't be able to just take over the internet with their old
fashion rules.

We've proved that they can't. We have decentralized technology, and secure
communications in the most cases. 

But Barlow doesn't mention corporations in his "A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace",
something that turned out to be a lot more effective in hindering our communications
and discovery of other people.

The internet used to be a wild west, which you connected to to learn about things
you didn't know before.
